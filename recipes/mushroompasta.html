        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This creamy pasta with cremini mushrooms is a tasty change from tomato or pesto sauce; on the table in about half an hour!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        
            <ul>
                <li>½ (16 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
                <li>2 cups sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
                <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
                <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 1/2 tablespoons spreadable cheese with cracked pepper (such as Boursin)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
            <ul>
        

        <h2>Directions</h2>
               
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving about 1 cup pasta water to thin out sauce later if necessary.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute mushrooms, onion, and garlic in the hot butter until soft, about 5 minutes. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat while stirring. Add flour, stirring constantly, to smooth out any lumps. Season with salt and pepper and continue to stir. Stir in cream; add cheese and nutmeg. Keep stirring; turn heat down to medium-low. Let simmer until thickened, stirring every 5 minutes to prevent lumps and sticking; you may need to turn heat down to low and add more butter.</li>
                <li>Mix in the cooked pasta and add splashes of reserved pasta water as needed to reach desired sauce consistency.</li>
            </ol>
